### Essential tasks for a baseline product
|Tick|        TODO    |
|-------------------|
|X| Randomly generate asteroid size/shape |
|X| Randomly generate black hole size/shape |
|| Bluetooth input |
|| Movement of ship |
|| Generation of chunked levels |
|| High score calculated after each attempt|
|| Physics of the black holes and astroid collision |

### Next Priority for well rounded solution
|Tick|        TODO    |
|-------------------|
|| Have varying difficulty on level chunks|
|| Coin/points collection for leaderboards as well as general high score (maybe player level) |
|| Animations on black holes as you go near them|

### Stretch goals
|Tick|        TODO    |
|-------------------|
|| Power ups |
|| Cosmetic items bought with in game points/coins |
