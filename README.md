# Gravity Rush

We present a mobile app solution for the rehabilitation of muscles following injury. Gravity Rush is an arcade style game controlled by two surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes placed on the target muscle, the sensors are connected to a mobile device via Bluetooth and provide data for a convolutional neural network that classifies the data into two different poses. These poses are used as inputs to control the game mechanics, which are based on navigating a rocket through space avoiding asteroids and black holes. Once a player hits a black hole the game ends and their score is recorded in a leaderboard, it is possible for players to build a friends list adding to the competitiveness of the game.
